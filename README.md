# VR-meditation-with-GSR-biofeedback-
A prototype VR meditation environment using a GSR sensor via Raspberry Pi Pico to provide rain-based biofeedback. Created for the "Training, Sensors and Simulation" course at the University of Twente. Based on the VR environment by @BerkcanAltungoz. Built by me with some help from Matteo R. Teagno, supervised by @schmettow and Dr. Funda Yildirim.
